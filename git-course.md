## Course Material

The following things will be needed to get started with the course.
-   a .pdf or hard copy (go used) of _**Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, 2nd Edition**_
-   access to a decently spec'd Windows Laptop or Macbook (around 4GB RAM / i5+)
-   access to WhatsApp 'Coding Help'
-   access to **this** documentation
-   **1 tbsp Brain**

## How To Learn

The book 'Pro Git' is actually quite thorough. Git is actually a very advanced tool and can be used for advanced requirements that many of us (including me) have never use or touched on. Rarely, you might encounter the need to conduct complex git commands to undo a near-fatal mistake, or to perform a complicated merging of code using say, rebase. Even then, it's mostly avoided through best practice. 

**The course will be primarily self-led** and you will be learning from the book and from conducting your own research on Google. On this page, you will find assigned exercises ('homework') which will test your knowledge and add relevant pressure to ensure you are learning and delivering at a good pace.

In addition to these exercises, I will be running open sessions on teams where you can raise topics you do not understand. I will then demonstrate and go through concepts that you are struggling with. I suggest you don't have your IDEs open in these sessions and try and follow along as I code; rather, you should make notes or use the code I put together to try these examples yourself. We will record some of the topics covered in these sessions on this page.

You can also raise questions on the **WhatsApp group,** this will be a good way to learn. 

To reiterate, I don't recommend you try and follow along with me whilst i'm demonstrating, or write notes. I will try and record all my sessions, but the most important thing is to understand the concepts. My goal isn't to teach you 'how' but lead you on to understand the 'why', so you can make sense of the 'how' when you do your reading. The technical stuff is easy -- it's the concepts which are difficult to grasp.

## Sessions
_You might have to log into youtube and have an invitation to be able to view these videos_

## Exercises
In this section you will find the exercises set, when they were set, and (if applicable) when they are due. If you are struggling, use the WhatsApp group so we can all help one another. Once you are familiar with Github / git, I expect these to be hosted out of git.
